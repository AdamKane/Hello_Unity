# Hello_Unity (2020)
This project is a minimal Unity application designed specifically for testing and build pipeline automation purposes. It showcases a streamlined setup to facilitate understanding and integration into automated systems.

## SampleScene Overview
The project includes a single Unity scene named `SampleScene`, which serves as the primary example for the application's functionality. This scene demonstrates basic Unity scene setup and UI element integration, suitable for automated testing and build processes.

### Main Components
- **Main Camera GameObject**: Includes a Camera component configured for both perspective and orthographic projection, and an AudioListener component for audio reception.
- **Canvas GameObject**: Acts as a container for UI elements. It has a Canvas component set to Screen Space - Overlay mode, and a RectTransform for defining its size and position.
- **Text GameObject**: A child of the Canvas, displaying "Hello World!" text. It includes a Text component for text rendering, a RectTransform for layout, and a CanvasRenderer for rendering on the Canvas.
- **EventSystem GameObject**: Manages input, navigation, and event systems within the scene.

The project's utility lies in demonstrating basic Unity scene setup and UI element integration, making it suitable for automated testing and build processes.
