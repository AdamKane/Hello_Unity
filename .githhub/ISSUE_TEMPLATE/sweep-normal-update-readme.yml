        1. Review the codebase.
        2. Make a list of all README.md files in the codebase repository.
        3. One-by-one, review each README.md file and give each an accuracy score of 0-100%, based on how well it describes the contents of the code in the same directory. (An empty or nearly empty README.md file should be given a very low accuracy score near 0%)
        4. Note the README.md file that has the lowest accuracy score, and thereby needs the most improvement.
        5. Print the path of this target README.md file.
        6. Finally, update the README.md file to improve its accuracy score.
